## Reporting a Vulnerability

**Please do NOT report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues.**

Instead, use [GitHub Security Advisories](https://github.com/srothgan/claude-code-rust/security/advisories/new)
to report vulnerabilities privately.

Please include:

1. Description of the vulnerability
2. Steps to reproduce
3. Potential impact
4. Suggested fix (if any)

## Response Timeline

- **Acknowledgment**: Within 48 hours
- **Initial assessment**: Within 1 week
- **Fix and disclosure**: Coordinated with reporter, typically within 30 days

## Scope

This policy covers the `claude_rust` binary and its direct dependencies. Vulnerabilities
in the upstream ACP adapter (`@zed-industries/claude-code-acp`) or Claude API should be
reported to their respective maintainers.

## Security Measures

- Dependencies are audited weekly via `cargo audit` (automated in CI)
- Dependency updates are managed via Dependabot
- All PRs require CI checks including security audit
